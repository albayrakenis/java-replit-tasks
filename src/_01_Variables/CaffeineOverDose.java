		//	Scientists estimate that roughly 10 grams of caffeine consumed at one time 
		//	is a lethal overdose. Write a program with a variable that 
		//	holds the number of mgs of caffeine in a drink and outputs how many 
		//	drinks it takes to kill a person.

		//	In one gram, there is 1000 mg. 
		//	Formula to get drink count to cause an overdose is

		//	Flow: Enter number of milligrams in drink: 
		//	It would take about # drinks for a lethal overdose.

	    //WRITE YOUR CODE HERE:
	    int numOfMilligrams;
